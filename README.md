## Features

- **Real-Time 3D Rendering** using Metal
- **Custom Vertex & Fragment Shaders** for lighting and materials
- **Dynamic Point Lights** with attenuation and time-based pulsing
- **Modular Codebase** for easy extension and reuse

### Shader Overview

The Metal shader (`shader.metal`) includes:

- **Vertex Shader**
  - Transforms vertices into clip space
  - Calculates per-vertex world positions, normals, and colors
- **Fragment Shader**
  - Computes lighting using:
    - Ambient, diffuse, and specular components
    - Distance-based attenuation
    - Time-based pulsing effects


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- macOS with Xcode and Metal support
- `make`, `clang` installed

### Build Instructions

Run the following from the root directory:

```sh
make -j8
```

The output binary will be located at `./build/renderer`.

### Run the Renderer

```sh
./build/renderer
```
